# Auto-Video-Editor-Compiler
This is an application that works best using the "Recort That" function to capture short increment video highlights. This application will then add an introduction video to the front, background music, and compile the last 30-5 seconds of all videos in selected folder. End result creates a professional and compiled YouTube ready video.
