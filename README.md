# Auto-Video-Editor-Compiler
This is an application that works best using the "Record That" function to capture short increment video highlights. This application will then add an introduction video to the front, background music, and compile the last 30-5 seconds of all videos in selected folder. End result creates a professional and compiled YouTube ready video.

## Downloads
- Official builds are published on GitHub Releases. Go to the Releases page and download the latest `.zip` bundle. It includes the app `.exe`, `ffmpeg`, `icons`, `Intros`, and `Music` folders.
- Direct-download format (replace with your tag):
	- https://github.com/Nicholasjknight/Auto-Video-Editor-and-Compiler/releases/download/<TAG>/Auto-Video-Editor-Compiler_<TAG>.zip

## Quick Start (Standalone)
- Unzip the release anywhere (e.g., `C:\Apps\Auto-Video-Editor-Compiler`).
- Run `BMagic_AutoVidCompiler_PERFECT.exe`.
- Optional launchers: `Launch_BMagic_AutoVidCompiler_Silent.vbs` and `Launch_UO_Video_Compiler.bat`.

## Notes
- The app expects bundled assets (music, intros, icons) and FFmpeg included in the package. Running the `.exe` alone will miss these resources.
- Source code lives in this repository; large binaries are provided only via Releases.
